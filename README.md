# QRC-for-Credit-Risk-Modeling
Quantum Reservoir Computing Implementation for addressing credit risk modeling

The Assignment:

----
Part 1: Implementation: Weâ€™d like you to build a Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) algorithm to address credit risk modeling using the dataset provided below:

Dataset: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data">Statlog German Credit Data</a>

The objective should be to get a recall above 0.50. <br>
Part 2: Original Ideas: You are encouraged to think beyond the conventional. Propose new and original ideas for implementing quantum reservoir systems or innovative algorithms.

----
To assist in this task, here are some useful resources on Quantum Reservoir Computing:

1. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06706">Introduction to Quantum Reservoir Computing</a>

2. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04799">Advanced Techniques in QRC</a>

3. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02553">Applications of QRC in Quantum Systems</a>

----

Note:
Required installation code (assuming numpy, matplotlib etc. standard libraries are already installed):<br>
!pip install pennylane-qiskit scikit-learn xgboost pandas

----
Also, note that I uploaded the dataset in Kaggle and used the platform to implement the first part. If you are running the notebooks in local PC or Laptop, keep the notebook and the datatset in one file and change the directory in the notebook for loading data accordingly.
